# MAT394 Machine-Learning-through-R SNU

Summaries of Lab sessions conducted by me as a Teaching Assistant for MAT-394-Machine Learning Through R (Spring-2021) at Shiv Nadar University, India. Click on the respective lab titles to access the code and datasets used.

## [Lab 1 : R Basics](https://github.com/mansigoel0029/MAT394---Machine-Learning-through-R---SNU/tree/main/Lab%201%20-%20R%20Basics)


This session covered basic commands in R which will be helpful in the subsequent sessions. Students were asked to install R and RStudio and installation related queries were cleared. 


## [Lab 2 : PLA](https://github.com/mansigoel0029/MAT394---Machine-Learning-through-R---SNU/tree/main/Lab%202%20-%20PLA)


Perceptron Learning Algorithm was demonstrated using a simulated dataset. Students were also given an insight into the  library ggplot2 for creating graphics in R. 


## [Lab 3 : Linear Regression](https://github.com/mansigoel0029/MAT394---Machine-Learning-through-R---SNU/tree/main/Lab%203%20-%20LR)


Linear Regression was demonstrated on the Cereat dataset. Students were shown how to split a dataset into training and testing sets and commonly used metrics to judge performance of regression models. 


## [Lab 4 : Non Linear Regression and Logistics Regression](https://github.com/mansigoel0029/MAT394---Machine-Learning-through-R---SNU/tree/main/Lab%204%20-%20Non-LR%2C%20Logistic%20Regression)


Non Linear Regression and Logistic Regression was demonstrated using the Boston and Smarket data respectively. Students were also given some practice questions to enhance their knowledge and understanding of the same. 


## [Lab 5 : Linear and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis](https://github.com/mansigoel0029/MAT394---Machine-Learning-through-R---SNU/tree/main/Lab%205%20-%20LDA%2C%20QDA)


Moving ahead with more classification algorithms, Linear Discriminant Analysis and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis were discussed in this lab.


## [Lab 6 : Cross Validation](https://github.com/mansigoel0029/MAT394---Machine-Learning-through-R---SNU/tree/main/Lab%206%20-%20Cross%20Validation)


Cross validation, a resampling procedure used to evaluate machine learning models was explained on the Auto and Cereal dataset. Bootstrap, a technique for estimating the accurary of a statistic of interest wa salso discussed. 


## [Lab 7 : Subset Selection](https://github.com/mansigoel0029/MAT394---Machine-Learning-through-R---SNU/tree/main/Lab%207%20-%20Subset%20Selection)


Various subset selection techniques were discussed - Best Subset Selection, Forward Stepwise Selection. 


## [Lab 8 : L1 and L2 Regression](https://github.com/mansigoel0029/MAT394---Machine-Learning-through-R---SNU/tree/main/Lab%208%20-%20L1%2CL2%20Regression)


L1 and L2 regression, more commonly known as Lasso and Ridge regressin was discussed.
