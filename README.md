# MAT394 Machine-Learning-through-R SNU

Summaries of Lab sessions conducted by me as a Teaching Assistant for MAT-394-Machine Learning Through R (Spring-2021) at Shiv Nadar University, India. Click on the respective lab titles to access the code and datasets used.

##[Lab 1 : R Basics](https://github.com/mansigoel0029/MAT394---Machine-Learning-through-R---SNU/tree/main/Lab%201%20-%20R%20Basics)


This session covered basic commands in R which will be helpful in the subsequent sessions. Students were asked to install R and RStudio and installation related queries were cleared. 


## [Lab 2 : PLA](https://github.com/mansigoel0029/MAT394---Machine-Learning-through-R---SNU/tree/main/Lab%202%20-%20PLA)


Perceptron Learning Algorithm was demonstrated using a simulated dataset. Students were also given an insight into the  library ggplot2 for creating graphics in R. 


## [Lab 3 : Linear Regression](https://github.com/mansigoel0029/MAT394---Machine-Learning-through-R---SNU/tree/main/Lab%203%20-%20LR)


Linear Regression was demonstrated on the Cereat dataset. Students were shown how to split a dataset into training and testing sets and commonly used metrics to judge performance of regression models. 


## [Lab 4 : Non Linear Regression and Logistics Regression](https://github.com/mansigoel0029/MAT394---Machine-Learning-through-R---SNU/tree/main/Lab%204%20-%20Non-LR%2C%20Logistic%20Regression)


## [Lab 5 : Linear and Quadratic Discriminant Analysis](https://github.com/mansigoel0029/MAT394---Machine-Learning-through-R---SNU/tree/main/Lab%205%20-%20LDA%2C%20QDA)


## [Lab 6 : Cross Validation](https://github.com/mansigoel0029/MAT394---Machine-Learning-through-R---SNU/tree/main/Lab%206%20-%20Cross%20Validation)


## [Lab 7 : Subset Selection](https://github.com/mansigoel0029/MAT394---Machine-Learning-through-R---SNU/tree/main/Lab%207%20-%20Subset%20Selection)


## [Lab 8 : L1 and L2 Regression](https://github.com/mansigoel0029/MAT394---Machine-Learning-through-R---SNU/tree/main/Lab%208%20-%20L1%2CL2%20Regression)
